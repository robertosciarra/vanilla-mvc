vanilla is a simple MVC framework for PHP that aims
  * to be simple to understand
  * to be straightforward to extend/customize
  * to let you concentrate on application-specific logic and the presentation of your website

It includes a simple database abstraction layer similar to perl's DBI, schema auto-discovery, easy management of related resources (css and js), and a live model browser.

It currently uses the Smarty Template engine, but other templating engines can be integrated.
